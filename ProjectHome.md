The Code for Community Challenge is a competition to create a mobile or web based app that meets a community need.  A mobile app is a software application that runs in a smartphone, tablet or other portable device. A web based app is a software application that is usable only with an active Internet connection.  The Challenge is limited to teams of 2 to 4 undergraduate students enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park.  To that end, we are working on an online "matchmaking service" to help students form teams, e.g. help programmers meet non-programmers.
